# Manual UI E2E Test Plan — Execution Modes, Memory, Workflows & Event Gateway

**Purpose:** Hands-on, click-through verification of the experience defined in the four design docs, done entirely from the Studio UI (with a few `curl`/`kubectl` helpers where the UI has no button yet).

**Design docs under test:**
- `docs/design/execution-models-and-memory.md` — shapes (reactive/durable), triggers, memory, workflows, isolation
- `docs/design/playground-execution-modes.md` — pre-publish evaluate surface (mode-aware playground)
- `docs/design/execution-modes-production.md` — post-publish operate surface (Agent Detail, approvals, alerting)
- `docs/design/event-gateway-threat-model.md` — public webhook ingress security

**Date written:** 2026-07-06 · verified against deployed cluster `agentshield-platform`.

## Production hardening (P1–P4) — execution modes PROVEN in production (2026-07-14)

The execution modes WS-1 delivered were only proven for **sandbox/playground**. This
pass drove each **production** journey end-to-end (no fakes) and codified them as gates.
Key finding: the production and playground paths **share** the dispatch/orchestrator/
trace code (both converge on `orchestrate_* → _run_step → _dispatch_durable_member`;
only `context` + HITL routing differ), so today's dispatch/trace/error fixes carry to
production — verified, not assumed. The recent "durable member timed out" prod failures
were a **stale image**, not a separate broken path.

**Proven + gated (no fakes):**
- **P1 — durable workflow golden path** (`suite-64`): create → deploy sandbox → REAL
  eval-runner Jobs (eval_passed gate) → deploy **production** → `POST /internal/runs/start`
  (`context=production`) → members complete on production pods, no timeout, parent trace
  obs=2 + member traces obs=9/9.
- **P2 — reviewer-console HITL** (`suite-65`): high-risk member (both gates — `eval_passed`
  AND attested `adversarial_eval_passed`) → parks with a `context=production`, `risk=high`
  approval routed to the **console** (not inline) → a `platform_admin` (authority) sees it
  via the authority-scoped list and approves → `_resume_and_advance` resumes at the
  production pod → workflow advances → completed.
- **P3 — production triggers** (`suite-66`): the **event-gateway** fires a webhook
  (`/hooks/workflow/{name}/{token}`) and the **scheduler** fires a cron `* * * * *`, each
  → `POST /internal/runs/start` → a completed production run (`trig=webhook` / `trig=schedule`).
- **P4 — cleanup + this ledger:** 9 stale `s55-*` parked runs (test litter, parked with no
  approval) cancelled; today's context-neutral fixes (parent/member traces, `_exc_reason`,
  `/echo`) confirmed in a production run (P1 assertions).

**deferred (intentional) — NOT execution-mode completeness, separate infra:**
- **Envoy hardened edge + safety-orchestrator input-scan proxy hop** — the canonical
  agent ingress TLS/rate-limit + input safety-scan hop. Login + JWT validation work
  without it; this is edge hardening, tracked separately.

## Trigger & daemon UX gaps (2026-07-14) — public webhook URL, template matrix, no-input runs

Three gaps surfaced while validating `trigger-demo-flow`. All fixed + tested this pass
(studio 0.1.134 / declarative-runner 0.1.44 / chart env + HTTPRoute; no image change to
registry-api — env/route only).

**Fixed + gated:**
- **Public webhook URL** (`studio/e2e/webhook-public-url.spec.ts`): the URL Studio shows
  was unusable — `EVENT_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_URL` defaulted to the in-cluster Service name AND
  the Envoy route exposed `/webhooks/` while the event-gateway serves `/hooks/` (no
  rewrite → `/hooks/…` fell through to the Studio SPA → 200 HTML). Fix: default the env
  to `global.publicUrl` (the gateway host) and route `/hooks/` at the edge. The spec
  proves, through the https gateway, that a created trigger's URL uses the gateway host
  and a `/hooks/` POST reaches the event-gateway (uniform 401 for a bad token, not the SPA).
- **Instruction template matrix** (`CreateAgentPage.test.tsx`): template selection now
  keys off the full **shape × class** matrix (user_delegated vs daemon changes the prompt,
  not just shape/trigger) — a daemon gets a "no live user, act on the payload" template.
  Daemon cells still specialize by trigger (schedule → cron job-spec, webhook → untrusted
  event payload). Covered by a component test across all four shape×class cells.
- **No user input for daemon/scheduled runs** (`suite-68`): a schedule/webhook can fire
  with no job spec — that produced an empty `HumanMessage`, which the LLM provider rejects
  (non-empty-content), so the run failed. Fix (shared runner code, same path production
  uses): `daemon_kickoff_if_empty` / `DAEMON_KICKOFF` never build an empty user turn — the
  run drives on a clean kickoff; the recorded input stays "none". `ChatRequest.message` is
  now optional. suite-68 provisions a real durable daemon agent and fires an empty-input
  run → completes.

**Workflow cost in Traces** (`suite-69` + `studio/e2e/workflow-cost.spec.ts`; registry-api
0.2.176): every workflow row showed Cost "—". A workflow parent orchestrates members but
makes no LLM calls itself, so reading cost from its OWN Langfuse trace (`_mark_parent`, and
the leaf-only backfill) always yielded NULL — while the members WERE costed. Fix: the
cost-backfill sweep now rolls member (child) costs up onto the parent
(`_rollup_workflow_parents`, sum by `parent_run_id`, after a settle window so the sum isn't
partial). Verified on real data (6 `trigger-demo-flow` parents → $0.000483 = child sum) and
in the browser (a workflow row renders a `$` cost). **Score stays "—" by design** — score is
a judge/eval result; trigger/scheduled/playground runs aren't evaluated, so there is no score.

**Known gap (not fixed here) — durable Event Trace sidebar:** the playground Event Trace
panel is wired only for **reactive** agents (ChatPane → onTraceEvent); **durable** runs
don't feed it, so the sidebar stays "No events yet" even though the trace exists in
Langfuse (reachable via `trace_url`). Frontend follow-up: fetch `getRunTrace` →
`getTraceById` → map spans → feed TracePanel for durable runs. **not-yet-wired (debt).**

**Where triggers live in the UI (answers "I don't see triggers"):** schedule + webhook
triggers are NOT on any list/detail page — open the **Workflow Builder** for a workflow
and click the **⚡ Triggers** button (renders once the workflow is open/saved). The webhook
token/URL is shown **once** on create/rotate (stored hashed); use **Rotate** to re-mint.

## Known gaps — Execution Models v2 WS-0 (agent_class authoring + shape-aware dispatch)

**Landed in this slice** (registry-api 0.2.156 / deploy-controller 0.1.36 / studio 0.1.127; migration 0058; suite-54): `agent_class` NOT NULL + CHECK on agents **and** workflows; create wizard split into Shape · Trigger · Class (R1); Settings + Workflow Save-modal Class selectors + save-time high-risk warnings (S2); shared `durable_dispatch.py` (single `/run` POST, parity); shape-aware production dispatch + `POST /internal/runs/{id}/step-update` callback writing `run_steps`; reactive workflow synchronous + wall-clock capped (M6/D2); reactive approval gate fail-closed via `_park_or_fail` (S2).

**deferred (intentional) — land in a later workstream:**
- **Real durable per-node steps + HITL park emit.** WS-0 wires the durable dispatch branch + step-update callback so `run_steps` appear for a production durable run, but the declarative-runner still emits its 2-step skeleton and does not yet emit an HITL park. Real per-node steps + park land in **WS-1** (shared durable harness).
- **Daemon identity / async approver routing.** A daemon agent is now authorable and deploys as `daemon`, but the OPA `user_identity_ok` rule + service-identity `run_by` + async reviewer routing land in **WS-2**.

**not-yet-wired (verify at deploy time):**
- **Deploy → pod env `AGENTSHIELD_AGENT_CLASS=daemon`.** The coalesce removal makes deploy read the column directly; suite-54 proves the DB/router invariants, but the live-pod env assertion is agent-image-gated (few agent pods deployed — the boundary the bash suites accept). **Manual check:** deploy a `daemon` agent → `kubectl exec` its pod → `env | grep AGENTSHIELD_AGENT_CLASS` should print `daemon`.
- **Playwright authoring specs** (`create-agent-wizard`, `agent-detail-modes`, `workflow-builder`) are written + compile-verified (18 tests) but their green run is deploy-gated — run `bash scripts/studio-e2e.sh` against the freshly-deployed Studio.

## Known gaps — WS-1 (durable engine) + a pre-existing fixture

- **[WS-1, deployed] durable park→approve→resume routing** proven by suite-55 (5/5) + suite-36 (4/0, workflow HITL) + suite-54 (14/14). The full **live-pod** park→approve→resume→complete through a real durable agent pod (and kill-pod→resume) is covered by the `durable.py` unit tests + this manual step — it needs a deployed durable agent with a genuinely high-risk tool. **not-yet-wired (fixture).**
- **[pre-existing, NOT a WS-1 regression] suite-45 HITL-trigger cases fail** because the seed sets `web_search` at `risk=medium`, so no HITL ever fires (001 `WRONG_RISK`; 003/004/007–010 cascade from "no approval created"). Upstream of WS-1 (approval *creation*, not resume). Fix = seed `web_search` at `high` OR relax the suite's risk expectation; tracked as test-data debt.

## Known gaps — WS-1 T5–T7 (workflow durable completion + approval UI parity)

**Landed in this slice** (registry-api 0.2.158 / studio 0.1.129; no migration; suite-56):
- **T5 (D3) — all four modes durably resume.** conditional/handoff/supervisor now park→resume→advance→complete (previously only sequential; the others "halted correctly but completed with member output"). The mode-specific cursor is checkpointed on park (node+visited_count for conditional/handoff; the supervisor accumulator worker_outputs+iteration+phase for supervisor) and `resume_orchestration` re-enters per mode. Proven by suite-56 (6/6, faked `_run_step`/`resolve_edge_graph`, same no-pod boundary as suite-36/55). Reactive fail-closed + sequential paths byte-for-byte unchanged (suite-36/54/55 regression).
- **T6 (D4 "+ Visibility") — durable members via `/run`.** A durable member (`Agent.execution_shape='durable'`) is dispatched to the member pod's `/run` (with `run_id=child_id` + step-update callback, `thread_id=child_id` for approval correlation) and the orchestrator polls the child run to terminal — so the member's per-node `run_steps` appear under the child in the run tree. Reactive members stay `/chat`.
- **T7 (M1) — one `<ApprovalCard>`.** `studio/src/components/approvals/ApprovalCard.tsx` is mounted by all three renderers (`HitlPanel`, `ConversationApprovalPanel`, `ApprovalsInboxPage`); a new approval field is added in one place. Vitest 186 + `ApprovalCard.test.tsx`.

**deferred (intentional) — later workstream:**
- **Within-member crash-restart** (a member pod crashing mid-execution, not at an approval gate). The orchestrator re-dispatches a durable member only after an approval decision, not after a crash — a mid-member crash loses that member's in-flight progress. This is the "full nested" durability tier (spec §9), a D4 documented limitation.

**LANDED (2026-07-13) — the live-pod durable-workflow leg now actually works.** This was
previously "faked in suite-56". Running it for real surfaced **six** defects on the live
`dispatch → pod → LLM → callback → route → park → approve → resume → advance` path — all hidden
because the suites stubbed that seam (see `docs/bugs/durable-workflow-live-path.md`): (1) the
durable-member callback URL used a non-existent Service name (DNS fail → 120s timeout); (2) the
builder run was hardcoded `context=production` (approval → console not inline); (3) Bedrock
content-blocks (a list) 500'd the callback's text-column write; (4) `_derive_context` didn't
resolve workflow-member `AgentRun`s (approval defaulted to production); (5) resume hit a
`-production` pod synchronously and never advanced; (6) `resume_durable` fed a state dict
instead of `Command(resume=…)` so the member re-parked forever (this broke ALL durable HITL
resume, single-agent too). Fixed in registry-api `0.2.160→0.2.164` + declarative-runner
`0.1.40`. **Now proven by `suite-58` (REAL, no fakes)** and a real park→approve→advance run.

**not-yet-wired (fixture / verify at deploy time):**
- **suite-58 is the real gate; the faked suites (36/55/56) are logic-only.** suite-58
  (`scripts/e2e/suite-58-workflow-live-run.sh`) creates its own agents, DEPLOYS real pods, and
  triggers a real run — asserting real dispatch→callback→completion. Keep the logic suites for
  fast isolated checks, but the live path is what suite-58 guards. **Manual check (HITL leg):**
  run `flow-conditional` with "I want a refund of $50…" → routes to wf-payout → parks → the
  inline card shows in the run panel → Approve → the run advances to completion.
- **Playwright `approvals-inbox.spec.ts`** drives the inbox render + Approve decide wiring against a route-stubbed pending item (deterministic, no pod). Its green run is deploy-gated — run `bash scripts/studio-e2e.sh`.

## Known gaps — WS-6 (operate parity: inline sandbox/playground workflow approval)

**Landed in this slice** (studio 0.1.130; frontend-only — no backend/migration change): the Workflow builder run panel now decides a **sandbox/playground** workflow's HITL **inline** — the reusable `<ApprovalCard>` renders under the parked member (correlated by `thread_id`, now surfaced on `ApprovalInboxItem` + `AgentRunItem`; both `thread_id`s were already on the wire via `ApprovalResponse`/`AgentRunResponse`). Approve/Deny calls the **console** decide (`PATCH /approvals/{id}` → `_resume_and_advance`, self-service for non-production), so the workflow advances **without** a trip to Catalog → Approvals. **Production** workflow approvals are deliberately never fetched in the run panel — they stay console-only (authority-gated). Proven by vitest `WorkflowBuilderPage.test.tsx` (+2: parked→approve fires the versioned decide; production run fetches nothing) and Playwright `workflow-builder.spec.ts` (route-stubbed parked→approve→PATCH journey).

**latent (by-design, dormant — not triggered today):**
- **`list_approvals` authority-scoping is not context-discriminated.** `decide_approval` gates reviewer authority on **production only** (sandbox/playground are self-service), but `list_approvals` applies its `X-User-Sub` authority filter for **every** context. This is dormant because Studio authenticates with a `Bearer` JWT and sends **no** `X-User-Sub` header (nothing injects it server-side), so the filter never runs for the inline fetch. If an `X-User-Sub`-bearing caller is ever added, the read path should be made production-only to match the write path (the correct fix: gate the scoping block on `effective_context == "production"`). Tracked here so it isn't a surprise.

**not-yet-wired (verify at deploy time):**
- **Live-pod inline leg.** The Playwright spec stubs the trigger/tree/approvals/decide endpoints (no durable member pod parks a real sandbox approval on this cluster — same fixture boundary suite-55/56 accept). **Manual check:** run one of the seeded durable workflows (`flow-conditional` / `flow-handoff` / `flow-supervisor`, member `wf-payout` calls high-risk `refund_action`) from the builder run panel → confirm the parent parks at `awaiting_approval` → the inline card appears under the parked step → click Approve → confirm the run advances (no console visit). Its green Playwright run is deploy-gated — `bash scripts/studio-e2e.sh`.

## Known gaps — WS-2 (durable daemon: identity + async approval routing)

**Landed in this slice** (registry-api 0.2.178+ / studio 0.1.135; migrations 0061 `agent_triggers.armed_by` + 0062 `approver_role`): a daemon trigger run now carries a **service identity** as `run_by`, decided by one shared `resolve_principal` / `resolve_workflow_principal` helper (`services/registry-api/identity.py`) keyed on JWT-presence — `/chat` = the caller, a trigger run = the service identity (daemon) or the arming human (user_delegated). The OPA `user_identity_ok` floor allows daemon + empty user and denies user_delegated + empty user (`missing_user_identity`). A daemon run's parked approval routes to a reviewer scope (`agent:reviewer` by default, or the trigger's `approver_role`), renders `principal_display` (`"service:X on behalf of Y"` / `"workflow:X (service) on behalf of Y"`) in the Global Approvals Inbox, and a **non-reviewer decide is rejected 403**. `armed_by` (the authorizing human) is captured on trigger arm/create.

**Acceptance proof:** **suite-70** (`scripts/e2e/suite-70-daemon-identity.sh`, 8/8 no-fakes — real daemon agent + workflow, real pods, real trigger run → real park→route→reject→resume) + Playwright `studio/e2e/approvals-inbox.spec.ts` (inbox card renders `"service:X on behalf of Y"`, reviewer-role filter, Approve fires `PATCH /approvals/{id}`, reload asserts decided) + the CP1/CP2 smoke scripts (`scripts/smoke-test-cp{1,2}-ws2-*.sh`).

**deferred (intentional) — land in a later workstream:**
- **Signed RCT / `actor_chain` cryptographic token verification.** WS-2 threads a plaintext `actor_chain` header for audit, but there is no signed request-context token minted + verified across service boundaries. Deferred to the **identity-propagation initiative**.
- **Email/webhook daemon approval notification.** A parked daemon approval routes to the reviewer scope in the inbox, but nobody is proactively pinged (no email/webhook fan-out to the reviewer). Reviewers must watch the Global Approvals Inbox. Deferred to future.

**optional / by-design (not-added):**
- **Persisted `approvals.reviewer_scope` column.** The reviewer scope is **derived at read time** from `agent_class` + the trigger's `approver_role` — it is not stored on the `approvals` row. This is deliberate (no column, no drift between the stored scope and the trigger config); adding a persisted column is optional if a future read path needs it without the join.

**not-yet-wired (debt):**
- **Trigger-run OPA-input propagation to the pod** → **identity-propagation initiative.** registry-api decides identity + stamps `run_by`, but does **not** propagate `principal.user_id` / `trigger_type` onto the agent pod's SDK OPA input for a `/internal/runs/start` durable/reactive dispatch (`agent_class` **does** reach the pod via the deploy env `AGENTSHIELD_AGENT_CLASS`). Effect: a `user_delegated` trigger tool-call currently **over-denies** at the pod (`user_id=""` → `missing_user_identity`) — this is **fail-closed-safe, not a leak** — rather than presenting the arming human. The OPA rule + the `run_by` identity decision are proven (CP1c); end-to-end reason propagation is the deferred piece.
- **Daemon workflow service-identity subject.** A daemon **workflow**'s audit principal uses a deterministic SA-name convention (`system:serviceaccount:production-<wf>:agent-<wf>-sa`) replicated across the service boundary (deploy-controller) rather than reading a stored `AgentIdentity` row. Cross-boundary naming drift risk. Low-severity — it is an **audit principal only** (the workflow parent orchestrates members and makes no tool calls itself), so a naming mismatch mis-labels the audit line, it does not mis-authorize a call.

---

## Known gaps — Eval v2 E-3 (scheduled eval: job_spec datasets + side-effect assertions)

**What the slice is for:** a scheduled agent's whole point is the side effect it fires
unattended on a job spec ("did the nightly compliance job send the right email?").
Response-only eval says nothing about that, so the publish gate was meaningless for
scheduled agents. E-3 restores it by asserting the **recorded** side effect against a
golden job spec. E-3 adds **no new scorer and no new dispatch** — it feeds the job spec
through the shared run path under E-2's record seam (parity-gated by `T-S75-000`).

**Landed in this slice** (registry-api 0.2.185 / studio 0.1.140; **no migration** — E-3
owns none, head stays 0063): `ScheduledDatasetItem` tightened to the structured E-1/E-2
models; `_resolve_eval_mode` + `_assert_mode_compatible` resolve `mode='scheduled'` from
the agent's **armed schedule trigger** rather than `execution_shape` (before E-3 every
scheduled dataset 422'd at launch and nothing downstream was reachable); the
`/eval/score mode=scheduled` branch (was 501) reusing `score_response`/`score_trajectory`/
`score_tool_calls`/`score_side_effects` with side-effect-skewed weights; the eval-runner
`MODE=scheduled` branch; the Studio job-spec editor + job-spec evidence render.

**Acceptance proof:** `scripts/e2e/suite-75-eval-v2-scheduled.sh` (`T-S75-000`–`009`) +
Playwright `studio/e2e/eval-v2-scheduled.spec.ts` + `scripts/deploy-cp1-e3.sh` /
`scripts/smoke-test-cp1-e3-{infra,behaviour,constitution}.sh`.

### ✅ RESOLVED — the blocker below is fixed; kept as the record of a whole failure class

**`9f6603a` ("E-3 scheduled eval P1-P4") changed four service directories and bumped only
two tags**, so the eval-runner and Studio code it added was never built into an image.
With `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` the node kept serving the pre-E-3 images and **E-3's
code had never executed once**. Its own `e3/tasks.md` T019 specified the exact bumps
(`eval-runner 0.1.11`, `studio 0.1.141`); execution dropped them.

| Service dir changed by `9f6603a` | Tag bumped by `9f6603a`? | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `services/registry-api/` | ✅ 0.2.184→0.2.185 | live |
| `sdk/agentshield_sdk/` | ✅ 0.1.47→0.1.48 | live |
| `services/eval-runner/` (2 files) | ❌ stayed `0.1.10` (E-2's tag) | **fixed → 0.1.11** |
| `studio/src/` (5 files) | ❌ stayed `0.1.140` (E-2's tag) | **fixed → 0.1.142** |

**Why every guard missed it — the lesson worth keeping.** `smoke-test-cp1-e3-constitution.sh`
caught "bumped one file only"; `smoke-test-cp1-e3-infra.sh` caught "the cluster does not
match the tag files". This was a **third case neither covered**: the source changed and
the tag was never bumped *at all*, so **both tag files agreed — on a stale tag — and the
cluster faithfully matched it**. Nothing was inconsistent. Every check was green while the
feature was absent. Agreement is not correctness when all sources agree on a number that
no longer describes the code.

⚠️ **It was safety-relevant, not just a false red.** On the stale image the reactive-inner
item E-3 must *refuse* **fired a real run** (`playground_runs` = 1 where the gate asserts
0) — a scheduled eval would have **delivered the real side effect**, the exact hazard E-3
exists to remove.

**Class fix (shipped):** `smoke-test-cp1-e3-constitution.sh` now asserts, per commit, that
a change under a service dir is coupled to that service's tag bump. Pointed at the real
offender it reproduces the defect in seconds:
`AUDIT_REF=9f6603a bash scripts/smoke-test-cp1-e3-constitution.sh` → FAILs eval-runner +
studio, PASSes registry-api + SDK. Run it before committing service code. Rule: **a tag is
a claim about content — after deploying, grep the image/bundle for a symbol the change
introduced.** Full write-up: `docs/bugs/e3-never-ran-tag-not-bumped.md`.

**Resolved state (verified, not inferred):** eval-runner `0.1.11` contains
`_run_scheduled_item`; the served Studio bundle carries `scheduled-job-spec` +
`job-spec-evidence` (both were 0). **suite-75 = PASS 12 / FAIL 0**, all 10 required cases
reported; `studio/e2e/eval-v2-scheduled.spec.ts` green.

**Honest limitation (not a gap — a property of the fixture):** `T-S75-007`'s *weight-set*
assertion is **vacuous when all four dimensions score 1.0** — the skewed, durable and
equal-weight sets all collapse to the same composite, so the composite cannot discriminate
them. The suite prints `discriminating=False` and says so rather than claiming a proof it
did not earn. The load-bearing half (all four dimensions present ⇒ E-1's scorers reused,
no scheduled-only fork) does hold.


**not-yet-wired (debt):**
- **Reactive-inner scheduled items cannot assert side effects.** E-2's record seam is
  armed only on the **durable** `/run` dispatch (the SDK/declarative-runner `/run` +
  `/resume` carry `eval_mode` and arm the ContextVar the governed-tool delivery edge
  reads); the reactive `/chat` path threads none. So a reactive-inner scheduled agent
  cannot record, and asking it to would silently **deliver** the real email/ticket/
  payment. The runner **refuses before creating the run** (`_run_scheduled_item`,
  `services/eval-runner/main.py:727-739`) and records the item FAILED — fail-closed, not
  a silent pass. Closing this needs `eval_mode` threaded onto the reactive `/chat`
  dispatch. `T-S75-008` is the gate.
- **The reactive-inner weight branch is dead code until the row above lands.** The score
  door's reactive-inner default weights `{response .4, side_effect .6}`
  (`services/registry-api/routers/playground.py:1311`) can never be reached with a
  `side_effect` dimension present: the only items that get one are items asserting side
  effects, and those are exactly the items the runner refuses for a reactive-inner agent.
  The branch is kept (not deleted) because it is the correct weighting the moment the
  seam rides `/chat` — but it is **unexercised** today. No test asserts it end-to-end,
  by construction.
- **Item `tool_mocks` not threaded to the seam** — inherited from E-2, no new debt. T001
  declares the field on `ScheduledDatasetItem` for contract parity with
  `DurableDatasetItem`; the seam still returns a type-default success sentinel
  (`{"status":"ok","id":"mock-<uuid>"}`) rather than the item's fixed mock.

**deferred (intentional):**
- **The eval fires through the SANDBOX door, not `/internal/runs/start`** (`e3/tasks.md`
  §D1). The real scheduled door is production-only, threads no `eval_mode`, and is
  **circular** with the publish gate (`deployments.py:560` requires `eval_passed` to
  deploy to production — you would need a published prod pod to earn the eval that
  publishes it). E-3 drives the identical job-spec shape (`input_payload=job_spec` +
  `trigger_type='schedule'` + `trigger_payload=job_spec`) through the **same**
  `dispatch_durable_run` → declarative-runner `/run`. `T-S75-009` keeps the real door
  honest with a live-delivery control. Revisit only if evals must run against published
  production agents (needs `agent_runs.eval_mode` + a non-circular deploy story).
- **Daemon identity on a trigger fire (`resolve_principal`) not re-proven by E-3** —
  WS-3's surface, gated by `suite-71` T-S71-001. E-3 scores run behavior, not identity
  resolution.
- **Cron-timing eval (does it fire at the right time?)** — E-3 fires the job spec once
  ("fire once, don't wait for cron"). Next-fire timing is WS-3's operate surface
  (`suite-26`/`suite-71`), not an eval dimension.
- **Alert-on-failure as an eval dimension** — out of scope; WS-3 verifies alerting
  end-to-end. E-3 scores the run's behavior, not the alert transport.
- **Record-once cassette replay for scheduled** — inherits E-2's mock-only limitation.

**boundary (Playwright, by design):** `studio/e2e/eval-v2-scheduled.spec.ts` proves the
authoring journey + save→reload→assert for real, but its **results-render half is
conditional**: rendering the job-spec evidence needs an already-completed scheduled
EvalRun, which needs a live daemon pod + the eval-runner Job + minutes of real LLM tool
calls — too slow/flaky for a browser test. It discovers a real completed run from the
backend (no `page.route`, no fabricated rows) and annotates a loud skip if none exists.
The real recorded-not-delivered + score persistence is suite-75's job. **While the
eval-runner image is stale, no completed scheduled EvalRun can exist, so that half always
skips** — it unblocks itself with the same one-line bump.

**Login:** `platform-admin` / `PlatformAdmin2024` (dev default). This user is `platform:admin` — it can see across teams, which matters for the isolation test (T0.3) and the approvals authority test (T7.3).

### 0.2 Helper terminals (keep these open)

You'll need two extra port-forwards for the production-webhook and event-log tests:

```bash
# Event Gateway — public webhook ingress (production event-driven tests, section 4B)
kubectl port-forward -n agentshield-platform svc/agentshield-event-gateway 8091:8091

# registry-api — direct API, used only for the helper snippets below
kubectl port-forward -n agentshield-platform svc/agentshield-registry-api 8000:8000
```

A shortcut to run API calls *inside* the cluster (no port-forward, no auth juggling) — exec into the registry-api pod:

```bash
RAPI=$(kubectl get pod -n agentshield-platform -l app.kubernetes.io/name=registry-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it -n agentshield-platform "$RAPI" -- bash
# inside the pod you can `python3` + httpx against http://localhost:8000
```

### 0.3 ⚠ Known gaps — expected behavior, do NOT file these as bugs

These are deferred-by-design per the docs/memory. The plan works around them explicitly.

> **Update (registry-api 0.2.61 / studio 0.1.45):** G-1 and G-3 are **RESOLVED** — trigger creation is now in the create wizard **and** the Settings tab, and all four orchestration modes run. See the tagged rows below.

> **Update (Decision 24 pass #3):** G-4 is **RESOLVED** — workflow-level triggers are now wired (Triggers panel in the workflow builder, scheduler + event-gateway dispatch via `workflow_id`). G-9 (below) tracks the deferred pausable-HITL orchestrator.

| # | Gap | Why / where |
|---|-----|-------------|
| ~~G-1~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED.** Triggers are now creatable from the UI: the **create-agent wizard** (4-way type picker → Scheduled/Event-driven adds the trigger) and **Settings → "New schedule/webhook trigger"**. The API snippets in §3.0/§4.0 still work but are no longer required. | `createTrigger` wired into `CreateAgentPage` + `SettingsTab` |
| G-2 | **Webhook payloads are NOT input-scanned.** `safety-orchestrator.enabled: false` in this deployment, so the T-10 input-scan hop is absent. Per-tool OPA/HITL still governs every tool call. | threat model T-10 / residual risk R-5 |
| ~~G-3~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED.** All four orchestration modes run: **sequential** (edge chain), **conditional** (edge conditions route via the `filter_engine` DSL), **supervisor** (a `role=supervisor` member routes, with a `max_iterations` cap), **handoff** (agents pass control). Pick the mode in the builder's Save modal. | `workflow_orchestrator.orchestrate()`; suite-30 |
| ~~G-4~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED.** Workflow-level triggers are now wired: `POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/triggers` (schedule + webhook), a **Triggers** panel in the workflow builder, and an `execution_shape` selector in the Save modal. The scheduler and event-gateway both dispatch workflow triggers via `POST /internal/runs/start` with `workflow_id`. See T6.4. | Decision 24 pass #3; migration 0031 |
| G-5 | **Publish is gated on two version flags, both set manually today.** (a) `eval_passed` — set via **Mark Version Passed** (auto-set from a passing batch eval, T-4, is not wired). (b) `adversarial_eval_passed` — required to publish **any agent whose version uses a high/critical-risk tool** (`agents.py` `has_risky` branch, 422 `adversarial_eval_not_passed`). This gate shipped in migration `0012` with **no producer**, so risky agents were unpublishable; a **Mark Adversarial Passed** button (Playground promote panel, studio ≥0.1.114) now PATCHes it — a distinct red-team sign-off, deliberately separate from the eval mark. Backend round-trip covered by suite-17 T-S17-006; button wiring by `PlaygroundPage.test.tsx`. **Residual (deferred-intentional):** no automated red-team eval runner yet — the adversarial pass is an operator judgment call, not an evaluated result. | playground doc T-4 / gate migration 0012 |
| G-6 | **Agent runs may not fully complete in sandbox.** Few agent pods are deployed; a durable/scheduled/workflow run may sit in `queued`/`running` (or fail fast at dispatch — the builder surfaces an "undeployed agents" warning). Assert the **UI wiring + run records + tree structure**, not necessarily a `completed` terminal state. | infra/local |
| G-7 | **Per-node tool/skill editing on the workflow canvas is deferred.** In the unified builder, an **inline** agent node edits its instructions/description/model in-place; **tools & skills** are managed on the agent's own page (link provided). Existing-agent nodes are read-only (edit on their page). | `AgentUpdate` has no tool-rebind field; documented follow-up |
| ~~G-8~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED (persistence).** `e2e/workflow-builder.spec.ts` "persisted edges survive a builder reload" seeds a workflow+edge via the API, loads the builder, and asserts **2 nodes + 1 edge (with its "approved" condition label) render after reload** — the real browser round-trip guarding the wipe-on-load regression. *Remaining nuance:* the drag-to-connect **gesture** still isn't automated (ReactFlow drag); it's exercised manually in T6. | Playwright `request` seeding + `.react-flow__edge` assertion |
| G-10 | **Sandbox HITL is environment-driven across 3 surfaces (2026-07-10, revised).** Context is decided registry-side (`create_approval._derive_context`), not by the pod. (1) **Sandbox deployment chat** → `context=sandbox`, a right-side **self-approve panel** (`ConversationApprovalPanel`) with inline Approve/Deny → auto-resume (leaves the production queue). (2) **Evaluate tab** → `context=playground`, existing inline `HitlPanel`. (3) **Dataset/batch eval** (`eval-runner`) → **auto-approve: the SDK skips the HITL interrupt** (gated on the trusted eval-runner identity, defense-in-depth; OPA allow/deny untouched) so batch runs never hang. **Production** deployment chat keeps the waiting-banner + console. Console shows **requested_by=username + team + deployment/env** (migration 0052). Proven by `e2e/hitl-deployment-chat.spec.ts` (sandbox panel) + suite-45 T-S45-009/010. Supersedes the earlier "console for all deployments" note. — **RESOLVED** | Design §8b |
| G-11 | **Playwright must run against the https gateway, not the http port-forward.** Keycloak now sets `Secure` session cookies, which Playwright won't replay over plain http — SSO silent-auth between specs breaks and every spec redirects to the login form. `scripts/studio-e2e.sh` auto-targets `https://agentshield.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8443` when reachable; `playwright.config.ts` + `global-setup.ts` set `ignoreHTTPSErrors`. Pre-existing specs failing on env/reseed drift (playground `Select Agent` text, agent-graphs/workflows/agents/deployment-overview visibility for `platform-admin`) are **unrelated to HITL** and tracked here as **not-yet-wired(debt)** — they assert on data/labels that reseed + RBAC changed, not on the HITL surfaces. | test-infra / reseed drift |
| G-12 | **Production deploy parity (2026-07-10).** Production agent pods now register their machine identity + enter the OPA bundle (migration 0055; shared `deploy-controller/identity.py`) and receive tool-credential `envFrom` (shared `tool_secrets.py`), so OPA governance + HITL + external-API tools work in production. **Still out of scope (documented, not regressions):** (a) **workflow-production member tool credentials** — `resolve_and_copy_tool_secrets` resolves via `/agents/{name}/tools`; a workflow name isn't an agent so it no-ops — **sandbox workflows have the identical limitation**, needs a member-aware resolver; (b) **Envoy HTTPRoute in production** — sandbox builds one, production doesn't; no impact until Envoy Gateway is installed. See `docs/design/sandbox-production-parity-architecture.md` + debugging 006/007/008. | Parity architecture doc |
| ~~G-14~~ | ✅ **RESOLVED (registry-api 0.2.149).** The M2 dashboard tool-call frequency/latency panel is shipped. It became feasible once OTEL `type=TOOL` spans ingested into Langfuse; the no-team-filter blocker is solved by fetching `type=TOOL` observations and keeping only those whose `traceId` is in the dashboard's own AgentRun population (team+env+window) — one paginated fetch + set-membership, no per-trace calls. `get_dashboard` returns `tool_calls[{tool_name,count,avg_latency_ms}]`; `ObservabilityDashboardPage` renders the panel. The dashboard is also now env-scoped (separate Production/Sandbox views). Verified live (sandbox: web_search 1×@1075ms). | routers/observability.py `_tool_call_stats` |
| G-13 | **Chat deployment pinning (2026-07-11) — wrong-deployment routing RESOLVED; parallel-prod deferred.** Consumer chat re-resolved the "most recent running" deployment at **stream** time instead of the deployment the run was pinned to at **POST** time, so a redeploy or a 2nd running deployment routed an in-flight chat (and HITL resume, whose thread checkpoint lives on the original pod) to the **wrong pod**. Fix: `_deployment_for_run` resolves the pod from the id stored on the run (`production_deployment_id`/`deployment_id`) — `stream_chat` + `resume_stream_chat` never re-resolve; `stream_deployment_chat` rejects a path `dep_id` that doesn't match the run (cross-agent guard); `start_chat` honors an optional `deployment_id` so a chat launched from a specific fleet row pins to exactly that deployment (Studio `DeploymentsPage` passes `?dep=`, `CatalogChatPage` forwards it). The **DeploymentOverviewPage "API Endpoint" card** also rendered the agent-scoped path for a *sandbox* deployment (real parallel pods) — now shows the deployment-pinned `/agents/{name}/deployments/{depId}/chat`; production stays agent-scoped (stable contract, one prod pod). Coverage: suite-46 (pin helper vs re-resolve + cross-agent reject), `CatalogChatPage.test.tsx` "pins the run to the ?dep deployment", `DeploymentOverviewPage.test.tsx` (sandbox endpoint card asserts the pinned path). **Deferred(intentional):** production runs **one** k8s Service per agent (`{agent}-production`, rolling updates — not parallel pods), so a deployment-scoped **URL** in prod resolves to the same pod; true blue/green parallel-prod Services are out of scope and would change the deploy model. | routers/chat.py; production_reconciler.py:108 |
| G-9 | **Pausable workflow-HITL orchestrator — sequential pause/resume implemented (WS-B); non-sequential and organic OPA deferred.** Backend: `agent_runs.orchestrator_state` JSONB checkpoint (migration 0032); authoritative pause-detection via pending `Approval` by child `thread_id`; `resume_orchestration` re-entry for sequential mode; parent run set to `awaiting_approval` with an amber badge in the WorkflowBuilderPage run tree and RunsTab. Deterministic coverage: suite-36. Organic OPA coverage: suite-37 — **gated on the OPA bundle/identity allow-path being green** (env fix applied in `manifest_builder.py`; bundle load + projected SA token identity must be canary-verified first). Prior notes said "Safety Orchestrator disabled" — that was a misdiagnosis; the Safety Orchestrator is a PII scanner and was never the approval origin (see Decision 26). Remaining deferred items: non-sequential auto-advance (conditional/supervisor/handoff modes halt at `awaiting_approval` but do not auto-resume-advance) — **deferred(intentional)**; organic OPA canary verification — **not-yet-wired(debt)**. | Decision 26 / WS-B — partially resolved |

### 0.4 Conventions

- **[UI]** = do it by clicking. **[API]** = helper snippet (a gap workaround).
- Use a unique prefix for everything you create, e.g. `mt-` (manual test), so cleanup is easy: `mt-reactive`, `mt-durable`, etc.
- Expected results are written as ✅ checks.

## T0 — Access, orientation, tenant isolation

### T0.1 — Login & shell renders `[UI]`
1. Open `http://localhost:8080`. You should be redirected to Keycloak.
2. Log in as `platform-admin`.
3. ✅ Studio loads with the left sidebar: **Build** (Agents, Skills, Tools, Workflows) / **Evaluate** (Eval Runs, Datasets) / **Catalog** (Marketplace, Approvals, Deployments) / **Observe** (Traces, Dashboard) / **Settings** (Models) / **Admin**.

### T0.2 — Agent list & detail shell `[UI]`
1. Click **Agents** (`/`).
2. Click any agent row (e.g. `research-assistant`).
3. ✅ Agent Detail shows the header (status + publish + shape badges), a **Deploy** and **Publish** button, and tabs: **Overview · Runs · Memory · Versions · Settings**.
   - _Maps to: production doc §3 (shared shell)._

### T0.3 — Tenant isolation (the fixed bug) `[UI]`
This verifies deny-by-default visibility from the execution-models spec §5.

1. On **Agents**, note the list.
2. ✅ As `platform-admin` you see published agents + your own. You should **not** see other tenants' private agents unless published or created by you.
3. Open the **Eval Runs** (playground) page → agent selector.
4. ✅ The selector list is scoped the same way (no foreign private agents leaking in).
   - _Maps to: execution-models spec §5.2/§5.5; the isolation fix in `list_agents`._

> Note: the 5 demo seeds (`research-assistant`, `calculator-bot`, `slack-notifier`, `echo-agent`, `order-agent`) are `created_by=system` + `private`. If you don't see them, that's isolation working — they're not published. Publish them or create your own agents for the tests below.

---

## T1 — Reactive agent: full lifecycle (create → sandbox → evaluate → publish)

_Maps to: playground doc §4, production doc §4._

### T1.1 — Create a reactive agent `[UI]`
1. **Agents → + Create Agent** (`/agents/new`).
2. Choose **No-code**.
3. Name `mt-reactive`, description "manual test reactive", **Execution Shape = Reactive**, edit the instructions template briefly, pick an LLM provider, select 1–2 tools.
4. **Create Agent**.
5. ✅ Redirects to `/agents/mt-reactive`; header shows a **Reactive** badge, publish status **Private**.

### T1.2 — Deploy to sandbox `[UI]`
1. On the detail page, click **Deploy** (→ `/agents/mt-reactive/deploy`).
2. Step 1: optionally enter an image tag → **Create Version** (or let deploy auto-create one).
3. Step 2: **Deploy** ("Deploy to Sandbox — ungated test deploy").
4. ✅ Toast "Sandbox deployment triggered"; Deployment History appears and polls; environment column reads **sandbox**.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §9 / OQ-D (`environment=sandbox`)._

### T1.3 — Eval Runs in the playground (chat) `[UI]`
1. Go to **Eval Runs** (`/playground`).
2. In the left selector, pick `mt-reactive`.
3. ✅ Center panel is the **ChatPane**; a purple **Sandbox mode** card + `sandbox` + `reactive` badges show.
4. Type a message → **Send**.
5. ✅ Response streams; tool-call chips appear if a tool is invoked; the **Trace panel** (right) logs events.
6. ✅ After completion a **Judge** score (0.0–1.0) appears; **👍/👎** feedback works; **Save to dataset** is available.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §4 + §8._

### T1.4 — Publish gate `[UI]`
1. Back on `/agents/mt-reactive`, click **Publish**.
2. ✅ Either a publish request is submitted (status → **Pending Review**), OR you're blocked with a clear reason (e.g. "agent has a critical-risk tool", or eval not passed — see G-5 / §8.4).
   - _Maps to: production doc §1 (eval-gated publish); Decision 20._

---

## T2 — Durable agent: run launcher, step tracker, HITL self-approve

_Maps to: playground doc §5, production doc §5._

### T2.1 — Create + deploy a durable agent `[UI]`
1. **Create Agent → No-code**, name `mt-durable`, **Execution Shape = Durable**, add a **high-risk** tool (so a HITL approval triggers), Create.
2. Deploy to sandbox (as T1.2).

### T2.2 — Launch a durable run in the playground `[UI]`
1. **Eval Runs** → select `mt-durable`.
2. ✅ Center panel is now the **RunLauncher** (not chat) — the header shows a `durable` badge.
3. Enter an input payload → **Launch Run**.
4. ✅ A **StepTracker** appears and fills in steps (`✓ completed` / `● running` / `○ pending`) streamed over SSE.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §5; component `InteractionSurface` → `RunLauncher` + `StepTracker`._

### T2.3 — HITL self-approve `[UI]`
1. When a step hits the high-risk tool, ✅ an **approval card / HITL overlay** appears showing tool · risk · **full args** (PII tokenized).
2. Review the args, click **Approve** (self-approval, sandbox — no authority check).
3. ✅ The run resumes from the checkpoint; step advances.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §5 notes (OQ-E: args always shown, no one-click approve)._
   - _If the run stalls in `running`/`awaiting_approval` and never completes → see G-6 (few agent pods)._

---

## T3 — Scheduled trigger: config, Run Now, production cron

_Maps to: playground doc §6, production doc §6. Scheduler is deployed (2/2 replicas)._

> **Scheduled agents now have a proper input contract (Decision 24 addendum).** A scheduled agent receives its schedule trigger's **`input_payload`** (a JSON "job spec") as its run input — the scheduler fires with only a `trigger_id` and `internal.py` resolves the payload. So: (1) the **create wizard** ships a scheduled-specific instructions template (autonomous parameterized worker — no "greet the user"), and picking **Scheduled** shows an **"Input payload (JSON)"** field; (2) the same field is on **Settings → New schedule trigger**, and one agent can carry several schedules with different payloads. Write instructions that parse the job spec, not a hard-coded task.

### T3.0 — Create a schedule trigger `[now in the UI]`
Create it in the **create-agent wizard** (pick **Scheduled** → set cron + optional Input payload JSON) or on an existing agent via **Settings → New schedule trigger**. The API snippet below still works headless (note the new optional `input_payload`):

```bash
RAPI=$(kubectl get pod -n agentshield-platform -l app.kubernetes.io/name=registry-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -i -n agentshield-platform "$RAPI" -- python3 - <<'PY'
import httpx
r = httpx.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/mt-durable/triggers",
    headers={"X-User-Sub": "platform-admin"},
    json={"trigger_type":"schedule","cron_expression":"*/5 * * * *","timezone":"UTC",
          "enabled":True,"alert_on_failure":True,
          "input_payload":{"message":"run the nightly sync"}})
print(r.status_code, r.text)
PY
```
✅ `201` with the trigger id (and `input_payload` echoed back). When this fires, the agent's run `input` is resolved from that payload.

### T3.1 — Schedule config + alerting in Settings `[UI]`
1. Open `/agents/mt-durable` → **Settings** tab.
2. ✅ **Schedule Triggers** card now shows a row with the cron `*/5 * * * *`, a timezone dropdown, an **alert email** field, and an **"Email me when a run fails"** checkbox.
3. Enter an alert email, tweak the cron, tick **Enabled** → **Save**.
4. ✅ Toast "Trigger updated".
   - _Maps to: production doc §6 (alerting first-class, email at launch — PQ-2)._

### T3.2 — Scheduled Overview `[UI]`
1. Go to the **Overview** tab.
2. ✅ Because a schedule trigger exists, Overview renders the **scheduled** variant (`OverviewScheduled`) — cron, next fires, last-run status, run history.
   - _Maps to: production doc §6 wireframe._

### T3.3 — Run Now (test-fire) in the playground `[UI]`
1. **Eval Runs** → select the scheduled agent.
2. ✅ Center panel is the **RunNowPanel** (cron preview + **Run Now** button); a banner explains the schedule doesn't tick in the playground.
3. Click **Run Now (test-fire)**.
4. ✅ A run starts immediately (same code path as a real cron fire), StepTracker/history updates, judge scores it.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §6._

### T3.4 — Production cron fires automatically `[verify]`
1. With the trigger **enabled** and cron `*/5 * * * *`, wait up to ~5 min.
2. Check the agent's **Runs** tab (or query `agent_runs`).
3. ✅ A run appears with `trigger_type = schedule`, `run_by = serviceaccount:scheduler` (the scheduler service fired it).
   - _Maps to: production doc §6 flow; scheduler service._
   - _Disable the trigger afterward (Settings → untick Enabled → Save) so it stops firing._

---

## T4 — Event-driven trigger: filter, Test Trigger, production webhook + security

_Maps to: playground doc §7, production doc §7, event-gateway threat model. Event-gateway is deployed (2/2)._

### T4.0 — Create a webhook trigger `[API]` (gap G-1) — capture the token!
```bash
RAPI=$(kubectl get pod -n agentshield-platform -l app.kubernetes.io/name=registry-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -i -n agentshield-platform "$RAPI" -- python3 - <<'PY'
import httpx
r = httpx.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/mt-reactive/triggers",
    headers={"X-User-Sub": "platform-admin"},
    json={"trigger_type":"webhook","enabled":True,
          "filter_conditions":[{"field":"event_type","op":"eq","value":"payment.fail"}]})
print(r.status_code)
print("TOKEN (shown ONCE):", r.json().get("token"))
print("trigger id:", r.json().get("id"))
PY
```
✅ `201`. **Copy the `token`** — it's returned once and only its hash is stored. You'll need it for T4.5.

### T4A — Playground (pre-publish) evaluate

#### T4.1 — Webhook Overview + Settings `[UI]`
1. `/agents/mt-reactive` → **Overview**: ✅ renders the **event-driven** variant (`OverviewEventDriven`) — masked webhook URL, filter, event log, matched/filtered counts.
2. **Settings** → **Webhook Triggers** card: ✅ shows the filter JSON and a **Rotate Token** button. Click **Rotate Token** → ✅ a fresh `/hooks/...` URL is shown once with a copy button; toast warns it won't be shown again.
   - _Maps to: production doc §7 (manual rotation — PQ-3); threat model T-1/T143._

#### T4.2 — Test Trigger: matched `[UI]`
1. **Eval Runs** → select `mt-reactive`.
2. ✅ Center panel is the **TestTriggerPanel** (filter shown, sample-payload editor, **Send Test Event**).
3. Payload that matches the filter:
   ```json
   { "event_type": "payment.fail", "amount": 12000 }
   ```
4. **Send Test Event**.
5. ✅ Event log shows **✓ matched → run**, a run starts (StepTracker), judge scores it.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §7 (same filter+run code path as production)._

#### T4.3 — Test Trigger: filtered (no run) `[UI]`
1. Send a non-matching payload: `{ "event_type": "payment.ok" }`.
2. ✅ Event log shows **⤫ filtered** with the reason; **no run** is created.
   - _Maps to: playground doc §7 (filtered ≠ dropped — critical for debugging)._

### T4B — Production webhook via the Event Gateway (threat model)

Requires the event-gateway port-forward (`:8091`) from §0.2. Uses the token from T4.0.

#### T4.4 — Valid webhook fires a run `[API/verify]`
```bash
curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:8091/hooks/mt-reactive/<TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_type":"payment.fail","amount":9999}'
```
✅ `202 Accepted`. Then in Studio → agent **Runs** tab (or `agent_events`): a matched event → run with `trigger_type=webhook`.
   - _Maps to: threat model acceptance criteria; production doc §7._

#### T4.5 — Security checks (threat model §5) `[API]`
Run each and confirm the expected code:

| Check | Command (abbrev) | ✅ Expected | Threat |
|-------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| Bad token | `POST /hooks/mt-reactive/WRONGTOKEN` | **401**, generic body | T-2 |
| Unknown agent | `POST /hooks/does-not-exist/<TOKEN>` | **401**, *same* body as bad-token | T-9 (no enumeration) |
| Wrong agent's path | `POST /hooks/mt-durable/<mt-reactive TOKEN>` | **401** | T-6 (cross-agent) |
| Filtered event | valid token, `{"event_type":"payment.ok"}` | **202**, logged `filtered`, **no run** | design invariant |
| Oversized body | valid token, >256 KiB JSON | **413** | T-5 |
| Rotated token | rotate in UI (T4.1), retry old token | old **401**, new works | T-3 / T143 |

✅ The event log (Overview) records `source_ip`, `status`, `received_at` for each.
   - _Maps to: threat model §5 acceptance criteria (should mirror suite-28)._

> Remember G-2: the payload reaches the agent **un-input-scanned** (safety-orchestrator off). That's expected here.

---

## T5 — Memory

_Maps to: execution-models spec §6; production doc §8.3. Memory tab is wired (`listMemory` / `deleteMemoryThread` / `clearAgentMemory`)._

### T5.1 — Enable memory `[UI or API]`
Memory is off by default. The create form doesn't expose the toggle, so enable it via API (gap-adjacent):
```bash
RAPI=$(kubectl get pod -n agentshield-platform -l app.kubernetes.io/name=registry-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -i -n agentshield-platform "$RAPI" -- python3 - <<'PY'
import httpx
r = httpx.patch("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/mt-reactive",
    headers={"X-User-Sub":"platform-admin"}, json={"memory_enabled": True})
print(r.status_code, r.text[:200])
PY
```
Then `/agents/mt-reactive` → **Settings**: ✅ **Memory = Enabled**.

### T5.2 — Generate + inspect session memory `[UI]`
1. **Eval Runs** → chat with `mt-reactive` for a few turns.
2. `/agents/mt-reactive` → **Memory** tab.
3. ✅ Session threads appear (thread id, message count); selecting a thread shows its messages.
4. ✅ **PII is tokenized** in what's shown (no raw personal data) — per §5.8/OQ-3.
5. Click **Delete** on a thread → ✅ it's removed. **Clear All** → ✅ all memory cleared.
   - _Maps to: execution-models spec §6.6 (Memory UI)._

---

## T6 — Workflows (composite executable) — build from existing agents

_Maps to: execution-models spec §2.6/§4.5, playground/production "Workflows" callouts. This is the Decision 22 feature + the fixed "builder forces new agents" bug._

### T6.1 — Build a workflow from existing agents `[UI]`
1. Sidebar → **Workflows** (`/workflows`) → **New / Create** → `/workflows/new`.
2. ✅ Empty canvas with prompt "Add agents to build your workflow".
3. Click **Add Existing Agent**.
4. ✅ Modal lists **composable agents only** (agents with no active schedule/webhook trigger, filtered via `?composable=true`), scoped to one team. Search box works; already-added show "Added". This ensures workflow members are pure capabilities that won't double-fire.
5. Switch to the **Create New** tab. ✅ The execution-shape selector shows only **Reactive** and **Durable** — Scheduled and Event-driven are not offered (workflow members must not self-fire).
6. Add 2–3 same-team agents from the **Existing** tab. ✅ They appear as member nodes on the canvas.
7. ✅ Adding an agent from a **different team** is rejected with a "Cannot mix teams" toast.
   - _Maps to: execution-models spec §4.5; `AddAgentModal`; Decision 24 pass #3 composable filter._

### T6.2 — Save the workflow `[UI]`
1. Click **Save**.
2. In the modal: name `mt-workflow`, team is read-only (derived), choose an **Orchestration Mode** (Sequential, Conditional, Supervisor, or Handoff) and an **Execution Shape** (Reactive or Durable; default Durable).
3. **Save Workflow**.
4. ✅ Toast "saved"; URL becomes `/workflows/<id>/builder`; a **Run Workflow** button appears.

### T6.3 — Run the workflow → run tree `[UI]`
1. Click **Run Workflow** → the right **Run panel** opens.
2. Enter an input message → **Start Run**.
3. ✅ A **Workflow Run** card shows the parent status; **Agent Steps** lists the child runs (one per member, in order) with per-child status + latency; it polls for updates.
4. ✅ This is the parent→child **run tree** (`parent_run_id`) — the whole point of Decision 22.
   - _Maps to: execution-models spec §4.5 (run tree + StepTracker)._
   - _Children may sit in `queued`/`running` (G-6); the tree structure + records are what you're verifying._

### T6.4 — Workflow triggers: schedule + webhook `[UI]`

_Maps to: execution-models spec §4.4 / §4.5 [IMPLEMENTED — Decision 24 pass #3]; resolves G-4._

1. Open the `mt-workflow` builder (`/workflows/<id>/builder`).
2. ✅ A **Triggers** button appears in the builder toolbar (next to Save / Run Workflow).
3. Click **Triggers** → `WorkflowTriggersPanel` opens.
4. **Add a schedule trigger**: set a cron expression (e.g. `*/10 * * * *`), timezone, optional `input_payload` JSON → **Save**.
5. ✅ The schedule trigger row appears with status **Enabled** and the cron preview.
6. **Add a webhook trigger**: choose Webhook → **Save**.
7. ✅ A one-time webhook URL is shown (format `POST /hooks/workflow/{name}/{token}`). Copy it — it is shown once; only its hash is stored.
8. Reload the builder. ✅ Both triggers are still listed in the panel (token not re-shown; URL in masked form).
   - _Note G-9: sequential mid-workflow HITL pause/resume is implemented (WS-B) — the run tree shows an amber `awaiting_approval` badge when a member pauses. Non-sequential auto-advance and organic OPA firing are deferred (see G-9). Assert trigger creation and the run-tree badge; full approval-gate exercise requires the OPA allow-path canary to be green (suite-37)._

### T6.5 — Workflow webhook fires a run `[verify]`

_Requires the event-gateway port-forward (`:8091`) from §0.2 and the token from T6.4 step 7._

```bash
curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:8091/hooks/workflow/mt-workflow/<TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"test"}'
```

✅ `202 Accepted`. In Studio → Workflows → `mt-workflow` → **Runs** tab (or query `agent_runs`): a parent workflow run appears with `trigger_type=webhook`.
   - _Maps to: event-gateway `POST /hooks/workflow/{name}/{token}`; execution-models spec §4.4 workflow run targeting._

## T7 — Production cross-cutting surfaces

### T7.1 — Runs tab is trigger-aware `[UI]`
1. On any exercised agent → **Runs** tab.
2. ✅ Table shows runs with `trigger_type` (manual / api / schedule / webhook), status, duration, cost, `run_by`, trace link.
   - _Maps to: production doc §8.2._

### T7.2 — Global Approvals Inbox `[UI]`
1. Sidebar → **Approvals** (`/approvals`).
2. ✅ Lists pending approvals across agents (or "No pending approvals. All clear."). Each item shows tool + risk + args + team.
   - _Maps to: production doc §8.1._

### T7.3 — Approval authority (production, not sandbox) `[UI]`
1. **Admin → Approvers** (`/admin/approval-authority`).
2. ✅ You can view/grant `agent:reviewer` authority for a team. (Production approvals are authority-checked, unlike sandbox self-approve.)
   - _Maps to: production doc §5 ops notes; spec §5.5 roles._

---

## T8 — Evaluation → publish wire (datasets + batch eval)

_Maps to: playground doc §8._

### T8.1 — Save to dataset `[UI]`
1. In the playground, after a good run, click **Save to dataset** (pin input/output to a golden set).
2. **Datasets** (`/playground/datasets`) → ✅ the item is listed.

### T8.2 — Batch eval `[UI]`
1. From Datasets, start a **batch eval run** for a dataset against the agent.
2. Open the eval run → `/playground/eval-runs/:id` (`EvalResultsPage`).
3. ✅ Per-item scores + pass/fail render (Haiku-judge scored, not keyword match — T-2 fix).

### T8.3 — Eval → publish `[UI]`
1. ✅ If the batch eval passes and auto-wire (T-4) is active, the version's `eval_passed` flips and **Publish** unblocks.
2. If it's still blocked (G-5), set it manually (§8.4), then Publish.

### T8.4 — Manual `eval_passed` fallback `[API]` (gap G-5)
```bash
RAPI=$(kubectl get pod -n agentshield-platform -l app.kubernetes.io/name=registry-api -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -i -n agentshield-platform "$RAPI" -- python3 - <<'PY'
import httpx
# find the latest version id, then PATCH eval_passed=true
v = httpx.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/mt-reactive/versions",
    headers={"X-User-Sub":"platform-admin"}).json()
vid = v[0]["id"]
r = httpx.patch(f"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/mt-reactive/versions/{vid}",
    headers={"X-User-Sub":"platform-admin"}, json={"eval_passed": True})
print(r.status_code, r.text[:200])
PY
```

## 9. Cleanup

After testing, remove what you created so you don't pollute the platform (isolation test T0.3 relies on a clean list):

1. **[UI]** Delete `mt-*` agents and the `mt-workflow` (Agent Detail / Workflows list → delete).
2. Disable/delete any triggers you created (Settings → untick Enabled, or delete via API).
3. Bulk test-artifact purge (gated): `bash scripts/purge-test-agents.sh` (dry-run), then `--yes`.
   - ⚠ The purge predicate currently keeps agents created by real user UUIDs — if your `mt-*` agents were created as `platform-admin`, delete them by hand.

|------------|------------------|------------|
| execution-models-and-memory.md | shapes, triggers, memory, workflows, isolation | T0.3, T1–T6 |
| playground-execution-modes.md | mode-aware evaluate surface (all 4 modes + workflows) | T1.3, T2.2, T3.3, T4.2–4.3, T6.3, T8 |

**Not covered here (deferred / out of UI scope):** rate-limit 429 + replay 409 (threat model T-3/T-4 — automated in suite-28, hard to trigger by hand), safety-orchestrator input scan (G-2, service off), non-sequential workflow-HITL auto-advance (G-9, deferred(intentional)), organic OPA require_approval firing (G-9, not-yet-wired — suite-37 gated on OPA bundle/identity allow-path canary).

## Known gaps — WS-4 (webhook client-id + allowlist + HMAC signing)

**What the slice is for:** a webhook trigger authenticated with **one coarse bearer token**
shared by every sender — no per-application identity, no revocation short of rotating the
token on everyone, and no request integrity. WS-4 adds per-application **client-id +
allowlist + HMAC request signing**, dual-mode so existing token senders keep working.

**Landed in this slice** (registry-api 0.2.186 / event-gateway 0.1.2 / studio 0.1.142;
**migration 0064**): `webhook_clients` (`secret_encrypted` TEXT, Fernet) +
`agent_triggers.auth_mode` + `agent_events.client_id`; a NEW `routers/webhook_clients.py`
at `/api/v1/triggers` keyed on `trigger_id` **alone** — one router serves agent **and**
workflow triggers; `event-gateway/webhook_auth.py` with **one** `verify_webhook_auth`
called by **both** hook handlers; the Studio client panel (register / reveal-once /
enable-disable / revoke / audit).

**Acceptance proof:** `scripts/e2e/suite-76-webhook-client-signing.sh` (`T-S76-000`–`009`,
**11/0**) + Playwright `studio/e2e/webhook-clients.spec.ts` (**3/3**, incl. a real
gateway 401 for a disabled client) + `scripts/deploy-cp1-ws4.sh` /
`scripts/smoke-test-cp1-ws4-{infra,behaviour}.sh`.

**Design decisions worth knowing:**
- **The secret is Fernet-encrypted, NOT hashed.** The gateway must *recompute* the HMAC,
  so it needs the raw secret back; a one-way hash is unimplementable here. Named
  `secret_encrypted` so the column does not lie about what it holds.
- **A webhook trigger is born `token` and upgrades to `client_signed` one-way on its first
  client registration** (invariant: `client_signed` ⟺ ≥1 client). Birthing it
  `client_signed` with an empty allowlist would mean a trigger that authenticates
  **nobody**, and — since `auth_mode` is not on `AgentTriggerUpdate` — there would be no
  API path to a token-mode trigger at all, so the legacy-token case could only be tested
  with a hand-crafted DB row (the exact fake the suite forbids). `T-S76-009` is the gate.
- **Revoking the last client does NOT revert to `token`.** A revoke must lock the door, not
  silently reopen the coarse bearer-token path.
- **Uniform 401 is structural, not remembered.** `_uniform_401()` takes **no arguments**, so
  the failure reason cannot leak into the response even by mistake; the diagnosis goes to
  the gateway log (`_deny(reason, **ctx)`). Two audiences, deliberately separated.
  `T-S76-003` asserts all five failure modes are **byte-identical**
  (`distinct_bodies=1`) — status codes alone would not prove the absence of an oracle.
  This also **closed a pre-existing oracle**: stale-timestamp used to return a different
  body (`main.py:262`/`:366`).

**deferred (intentional):**
- **Replay nonce is opt-in and keyed on `agent_name`, not `client_id`.** Contrary to the
  plan's "v1 uses the 300s window only", replay protection already ships
  (`X-Webhook-Nonce` → `rate_limiter.py::check_nonce`, Redis `SET NX`, fail-closed). The
  real, narrower gap: a sender that omits the nonce header gets window-only protection, so
  a replay **inside 300s** is possible; and the nonce namespace is per-agent, so it does
  not isolate one client from another. Making it mandatory + client-scoped is a follow-up.
- **Per-client rate limits.** Rate limiting stays per-trigger (the existing `rate_limiter`);
  a noisy client can still exhaust a quiet one's budget. Per-client limits are a follow-up.

**not-yet-wired (debt):**
- **No trigger-scoped ownership check on the client router.** Any authenticated caller who
  knows a `trigger_id` can register/revoke clients on it. This mirrors the sibling trigger
  routers (which have the same gap) and was deliberately not widened here, but it IS a real
  authz hole — a client registration is a credential grant. Documented in the router's
  module docstring. Fix = the same scoping the trigger routers need.
- **Senders are not migrated off `token`, and the flag is not deleted.** Dual-mode ships;
  every existing trigger stays `token` until a client is registered on it. Deleting
  `auth_mode` waits until every sender is on `client_signed`.
- **`charts/agentshield/charts/*.tgz` shadow their source sub-charts — a live landmine.**
  The event-gateway tag bump silently did nothing (deploy reported "successfully rolled
  out" while serving **0.1.1**) because a stale untracked `event-gateway-0.1.0.tgz` pinned
  the old tag and `helm dependency update` fails inside `deploy-cpe2e.sh:386`, swallowed by
  `2>/dev/null || true`. Worked around by pinning the tag in the **top-level** values.yaml
  (the pattern registry-api/studio/deploy-controller already use, immune to the artifact).
  **Still-stale `.tgz` files remain for studio, deploy-controller, scheduler, python-executor
  and others** — any future sub-chart tag edit will silently no-op the same way. Real fix =
  make `deploy-cpe2e.sh` fail loudly on a dep-update error and stop committing/keeping stale
  `.tgz` artifacts; deferred because it needs an unrelated envoy-gateway constraint fixed.

**manual check (suite boundary):** `suite-76` and `suite-28` share one pod IP and suite-28
exhausts the per-IP rate-limit budget by design, so `smoke-test-cp1-ws4-behaviour.sh` waits
65s between them. `suite-66` (production webhook triggers, ~30-40min real-LLM) was not
re-run; its workflow bare-token path is the same `verify_webhook_auth`, covered structurally
by `T-S76-004` + suite-28.
